# Policy security

The canonical policy is `AGENTS.md`. Supporting documents remain local to the
repository. The loader never fetches policy text from the network.

The loader rejects missing, malformed, non-ASCII, oversized, symlinked, and
special files. It rejects absolute paths and paths that escape the policy root.
It assembles deterministic output and fails closed.

Repository hooks can be modified by repository writers. Use an external
harness, filesystem isolation, or server-side controls for tamper resistance.

Do not place secrets, credentials, tokens, private keys, or sensitive
vulnerability details in policy documents, examples, logs, handoffs, or
generated copies.

Secret categories include keys, tokens, passwords, private keys, and `.env`
files. If a secret enters version control, stop committing and recommend
rotation. The secret checker uses heuristics. It does not perform entropy
analysis or prove that a repository contains no secret.

Use bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 with salt and work factor for passwords. Use
SHA-256 or SHA-3 for general hashing. Never use MD5 or SHA-1 for security.
Example cache use: `hashlib.md5(payload).hexdigest()` with a comment stating
that the digest is non-cryptographic.

A comment cannot convert a security-sensitive use into a non-security use.

For runtime-root containers, prefer ports of 1024 or higher behind a reverse
proxy or port mapping. Prefer `COPY --chown` or build-time `chown`. Set
`user:` in Compose. Set `securityContext.runAsNonRoot: true` and `runAsUser`
in Kubernetes. After approval, add:

`# runtime-root: this container <reason> (Rule 12 exception).`

Flag unrelated runtime-root findings instead of fixing them under Rule 4.
`scripts/check_dockerfile_root.py` checks the rule.

Preserve license-required attribution and source metadata in every controlled
adoption and redistribution. Third-party mirrors remain responsible for their
own legal compliance. This repository cannot enforce or verify their local
practices.

Report vulnerabilities through the process in `SECURITY.md.example`. Do not
use public issues or pull requests for private vulnerability details.

`AGENTS.md` controls when linked documents conflict with it.

Avoid nested quantifiers such as `(x+)+` and overlapping patterns. Use atomic
groups, possessive quantifiers, or simpler expressions.

Git transport over SSH is allowed through Git commands. Direct SSH client
execution remains denied. Shell gates deny protected commands and paths. The
Claude file-tool gate denies protected file operations and broad searches.
Other clients may lack equivalent file-tool coverage. External controls remain
necessary for tamper resistance.

Injection examples:

- Bad: `cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{name}'")`
- Good: `cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = %s", (name,))`
- Bad: `subprocess.run(f"convert {filename} out.png", shell=True)`
- Good: `subprocess.run(["convert", filename, "out.png"])`

## Denied command families

The denial covers AWS CLI, SAM, CDK, Azure CLI and PowerShell, Google Cloud
CLI, `gsutil`, `bq`, Terraform, OpenTofu, Terragrunt, Pulumi, Packer,
Kubernetes, Helm, Kustomize, OpenShift, Minikube, Kind, SSH clients, PuTTY,
FTP, TFTP, Telnet, iptables, nftables, UFW, firewalld, and Windows firewall
commands.

Git transport over SSH remains allowed through Git. Direct SSH clients remain
denied.

Protected content includes AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, SSH, Kubernetes,
Terraform, FTP, and Netrc credentials, Terraform source, variables, state,
locks and CLI configuration, plus Kubernetes, Helm, and Kustomize manifests
and project directories.

## Repository scoping: Cloudflare tooling

This repository deploys to Cloudflare with `wrangler`. The denial above does
not cover `wrangler`. Rule 14 in `AGENTS.md` names this scoping.

Non-destructive `wrangler` operations remain allowed without a prompt:

- `wrangler dev` and every local emulation
- `wrangler types` and other generated-code output
- Read-only inspection such as `wrangler whoami`, `wrangler deployments list`,
  and `wrangler tail`

State-changing or destructive `wrangler` operations require active-human
consent before execution:

- `wrangler deploy` and `wrangler versions upload`
- Secret and variable writes
- KV, R2, D1, and DNS mutations
- Deletions of any resource

The CI header-check pipeline runs `wrangler dev` locally.

`actions/checkout` writes an ephemeral `GITHUB_TOKEN` to Git configuration when
`persist-credentials` remains true. Later steps and third-party actions can
read it. Set `persist-credentials: false` unless a listed exception applies.
Use the exact exception comment required by `AGENTS.md`.

Build-time package installation may run as root. Runtime containers must not.
Prefer ports at or above 1024 behind a proxy. Prefer `COPY --chown` or
build-time ownership changes. Compose services set `user:`. Kubernetes pods
set `securityContext.runAsNonRoot: true` and `runAsUser`.
